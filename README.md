## üõ† Step-by-Step Configuration

### **1. Configure Appwrite**

1. **Set up Appwrite**:

   * Install and launch the [Appwrite server](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation).
   * Create a new project in the Appwrite console.

2. **Set up collections**:

   * Navigate to the **Database** section.
   * Create the following collections:

     * **Users**: To store user information.
     * **Patients**: To store patient details.
     * **Appointments**: To manage appointment data.

3. **Add environment variables**:

   * Go to your `.env.local` file and configure:

     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=<Your Appwrite Endpoint>
     PROJECT_ID=<Your Appwrite Project ID>
     ```

### **2. Configure JWT**

1. **Generate a secure secret key**:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

   Copy the generated key and add it to your `.env` file as `JWT_SECRET`.

2. **How JWT works**:

   * **Admin Authentication**:

     * The admin logs in using a passkey.
     * The server validates the passkey and generates a JWT signed with the secret key.
     * The JWT contains information about the user role (`admin`) and an expiration time.
   * **Authorization Check**:

     * Admin pages verify the JWT stored in cookies to ensure only authorized users can access the content.
     * If the JWT is invalid or missing, the user is redirected to the login page.

3. **Update your environment for deployment**:

   * When deploying, set the `JWT_SECRET` in your hosting environment variables (e.g., Vercel, AWS) for security.

### **3. Configure Twilio**

1. **Create a Twilio account**:
   Visit [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) and sign up for an account.

2. **Obtain a Twilio phone number**:

   * Go to the **Phone Numbers** section.
   * Click **Get a Number** to acquire a phone number.

3. **Set up Verified Caller ID**:

   * Navigate to **Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Verified Caller ID**.
   * Add your personal phone number and verify it.

4. **Retrieve Twilio credentials**:

   * Go to the **Dashboard** and copy your **Account SID**, **Auth Token**, and **Sender number**.
   * Add these credentials to your `.env` file.

5. **Integrate Twilio in Appwrite**:

   * In your Appwrite project, add a function for handling Twilio SMS notifications.
   * Use the Twilio SDK in your Appwrite function to send appointment confirmations.
